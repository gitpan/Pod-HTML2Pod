	* Release 4.04

	* I first modlist-register my idea for Pod::HTML2Pod.  Things keep
	pulling me away from it -- like getting HTML::TreeBuilder to work
	right, which is sort of a logical prerequisite.  Over the months,
	I write and scrap about four different "near-working" (i.e.,
	nearly useless) versions of Pod::HTML2Pod.
